        identity: "Black, African American",

        alignment: "Good",
        bio1: `King possesses a significant amount of powers and abilities and, surprisingly
        unlike many powerful heroes of his kind, he uses all of them in combat. King
        attacks with lightning fast power and precision. His goal is to avoid
        unnecessary mayhem by ending every combat encounter as fast as possible,
        sometimes in milliseconds. Whether that takes one strike or dozens is up to
        the durability of his enemy. In battle, King taps into his superhuman senses,
        almost using them like a scouter to help read his enemy’s composure, power
        level and intentions. Before enemy engagement, King takes a split second
        analysis of the situation to make sure that he and his enemy are facing each
        other in a head on fight so no innocent civilians get hurt. It’s safe to say that
        getting the drop on King is nearly impossible.`,
        bio2: `King doesn’t rely solely on his immense power to win a fight. He is very aware
        that even though small, the possibility of coming across a foe of equal or
        greater strength exists. For this reason, King refuses to rely on being a
        bumbling brawler and has instead learned multiple combat disciplines from
        some of the best trainers in the world. King constantly trains to hone his
        power to make sure that he never uses more or less force than is necessary to
        defeat the enemy at hand.`,
        bio3: `Alexander King’s personality was once perfectly described by a close friend as
        being profound yet understated. When everyone in the room knows that you
        possess superpowers, you don't have to say much to get your point across. One
        of King’s most important superpowers is his superhuman senses. This allows
        him to easily read every person in a room and know how to properly address
        them. Because of the power that he possesses, King is always aware that the
        world abroad is constantly watching his every move and dissecting his every
        word. This can sometimes lead King to be a reticent man, every action having
        purpose and every word well thought out. However, he’s not a robot and he
        learned at a young age not to let the world’s expectations force him to live his
        life like one. King is known for being a very easy going and down-to-earth
        person with a good sense of humor that likes to have fun. At his core, King is a
        genuinely compassionate person that places a major emphasis on family and
        community.`,
        bio4: `Effortlessly charismatic, smooth, suave and debonair are just a few of the
        terms that have often been used to describe Alexander King’s demeanor. King
        naturally exudes a coolness and calmness that is infectious and can easily
        bring a sense of peacefulness and safety to those around him. King always
        maintains a steady disposition and never allows himself to get too high or too
        low.`

        occupation: "Renewable Energy Scientist / Environmental Scientist & Activist",
        alignment: "Good",
        bio1: `Solfire’s combat is centered around her solar abilities granted to her by the RA
        CONDUIT. Not only does it give her access to a multitude of flashy solar based
        powers, but it also increases her physical capabilities including strength, speed
        and durability. Solfire has learned to use her solar powers in a variety of
        creative ways including energy beams for distance combat and igniting her
        fists and feet into flames so that her melee attacks do added fire damage.`,
        bio2: `Though her solar powers are a core component of her fighting style, it’s not
        the only thing that makes her a great combatant. Since her teens, Serena has
        always been involved in athletics, fitness training and martial arts. So a
        physical confrontation is not foreign to her and her body has been trained to
        withstand a combat situation. This along with her great strength due to
        extensive cross-fit training makes her a very formidable combatant even
        without solar abilities.`,
        bio3: `Serena Summers’ personality can easily be described as sunny. Serena is
        always upbeat and high energy. Possessing a genius level IQ, Serena is a quick
        thinker and incredible multi-tasker that likes to stay busy partaking in any of
        the multitude of hobbies she loves. Having competed and succeeded in
        multiple sports and contests as a youth, Serena is a very competitive person
        that loves inviting those around her to a friendly competition.`,
        bio4: `Serena Summers carries herself with an air of strength and confidence. Her
        demeanor makes it immediately clear that she is a person to be respected.
        With that said, Serena is a very cheerful person that tends to light up any room
        that she enters. She has been described by her close friends as having the type
        of smile that makes you want to smile when you see it.`

        hometown: "Brooklyn, New York",
        occupation: "Retired Professional Boxer / Philanthropist / Community Activist",
        alignment: "Good",
        bio1: `ReFlex’s approach to combat is centered around his Preemptive Auto Reflex
        Ability. During his career as a professional boxer, Flex was known for his
        emphasis on defense and, as a result, he often sacrificed his full offensive
        capabilities. Fortunately for Reflex, his Preemptive Auto Reflex Ability
        passively takes care of all defensive responsibility allowing him to focus
        entirely on his offensive attacks. This means that ReFlex can put full effort
        into hitting with far more power and speed than he ever did before.`,
        bio2: `ReFlex was an all-time great in boxing, so he has mastered how to throw every
        type of punch from nearly any angle. This comes in handy as his Preemptive
        Auto Reflex Ability can cause him to make unpredictably unorthodox
        movements to avoid enemy attacks and he is prepared with a plethora of
        unorthodox strikes to quickly counter his attacker. Because of his background
        in boxing, ReFlex’s offense almost entirely consists of punches, however, he
        has recently begun mixed martial arts training to add kicks and elbows to his
        repertoire.`,
        bio3: `Flex Cooper’s personality can be best described as lighthearted and easy going.
        Considering himself somewhat of a comedian, he often likes to crack jokes and
        make people laugh. Flex is a very optimistic person and always tries to see the
        positive side of things, even when faced with a bad situation. Given the event
        of being paralyzed, this can often be viewed as a coping mechanism. But those
        close to Flex know that he is a genuinely happy guy grateful to have survived
        the incident, let alone walk again, and he cherishes every day.`,
        bio4: `Flex Cooper’s demeanor is that of a man sure of himself in every facet of life.
        Known for being a well-rounded fighter, he takes this approach into his
        everyday life and is never out of his element no matter the environment. He
        always remains cool, calm and collected even in the most hectic of situations.
        Most wouldn’t even know that he was a famous athlete because he carries
        himself like an everyman but still presents an aura that anyone around him
        would know is special.`
